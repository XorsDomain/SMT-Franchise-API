# SMT-Franchise-API
This is a personal project of something that most likely exists. 

This API is just a REST API database of all creatures (labeled personas or demons) from the Shin Megami Tensei series. This will include the mainlines games (Megami Tensei and Shin Megami Tensei), and popular spin-offs (Example: Soul Hackers, Digital Devil Summoner, and the Persona series).

This README will be updated with instructions on how to set up the API on a different PC, and how to run requests to show desired information.

Since these creatures already exist, they will all be in the SeedData file.

This project will still have REST API full functionality, such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, however I will only use GET for results. The other 3 functions will be created to show the full functionality of REST.
